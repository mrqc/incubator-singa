'''
Loss module includes a set of training loss implmentations. Some are converted
from C++ implementation, and the rest are implemented directly using python
Tensor.

Example usage::

    from singa import tensor
    from singa import loss
    from singa.proto import model_pb2

    x = tensor.Tensor((3, 5))
    x.uniform(0, 1)  # randomly genearte the prediction activation
    y = tensor.from_numpy(np.array([0, 1, 3], dtype=np.int))  # set the truth

    f = loss.SoftmaxCrossEntropy()
    l = f.forward(model_pb2.kTrain, x, y)  # l is tensor with 3 loss values
    g = f.backward()  # g is a tensor containing all gradients of x w.r.t l
